### 题目

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### 思路

这道题，滑动窗口解法

> new_substr = substr + [next_char(if no repeat)]

使用两个指针, start和end, start分别标记无重复substr的起始点

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        max_len = 0
        start = 0
        end  = 0
        cache = {}
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in cache:
                start = max(cache[s[i]] + 1, start)
            
            cache[s[i]] = i
            end = i
            max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)
            
        return max_len
```
