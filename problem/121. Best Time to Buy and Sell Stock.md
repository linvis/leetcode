## 题目

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## 思路

题目限制了只允许买卖一次，所以该题目等价于，把prices数组分成a, b两部分，找出a的最小值，b的最大值，两者相减即为最大获利

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
    if len(prices) <= 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    buy, profit := prices[0], 0
    
    for _, p := range prices {
        if p < buy {
            buy = p
            continue
        }
        
        if p - buy > profit {
            profit = p - buy
        }
    }
    
    return profit
}
```
