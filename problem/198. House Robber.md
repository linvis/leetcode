## 题目

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## 思路

DP

$Sum_n = max(S_{n-1,\ not\ chosen} + n, S_{n-1,\ chosen}, Sum_{n-1})$

对于第n个房子，它由两种途径到达，n-1(不别抢) + n(被抢), n-1(被抢) + n(不被抢)

另外，要考虑连续不抢某个房子的情况([5,1,1,20])，即 p2 = max(p1, p2)

```go
func max(a []int) int {
    m := 0
    for _, n := range a {
        if n > m {
            m = n
        }
    }
    
    return m
}

func rob(nums []int) int {
    // p1: chosen, p2: not chosen
    sum, p1, p2 := 0, 0, 0
    
    for i:= 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
        sum = max([]int{p1, p2 + nums[i], sum})
        p1, p2 = p2 + nums[i], max([]int{p1, p2})
    }

    return sum
}
```
