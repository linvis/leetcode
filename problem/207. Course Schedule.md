## 题目

There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

## 思路

### 解法1

根据题目要求，可以得知，这题就是求一个图的路径中是否存在环

一种思路：使用DFS检查路径

```go
func isNumInArray(a []int, b int) bool {
    for _, v := range a {
        if v == b {
            return true
        }
    } 
    return false
}

var seen []int

func dfs(path []int, node int, graph map[int]([]int)) bool {
    if _, ok := graph[node]; !ok {
        return true
    }
    
    path = append(path, node)
    seen = append(seen, node)
    
    for i := 0; i < len(graph[node]); i++ {
        if isNumInArray(path, graph[node][i]) {
            return false
        }
        if isNumInArray(seen, graph[node][i]) {
            continue
        }
        if dfs(path, graph[node][i], graph) == false {
            return false
        }
    }
    
    return true
}

func canFinish(numCourses int, prerequisites [][]int) bool {
    graph := make(map[int]([]int))
    seen = []int{}
    
    for i := 0; i < len(prerequisites); i++ {
        prev := prerequisites[i][0]
        for j := 1; j < len(prerequisites[i]); j++ {
            if _, ok := graph[prev]; !ok {
                graph[prev] = []int{prerequisites[i][j]}
            } else {
                graph[prev] = append(graph[prev], prerequisites[i][j])
            }
            prev = prerequisites[i][j]
        }
    }
    
    for k, _ := range graph {
        if dfs([]int{}, k, graph) == false {
            return false
        }
    }
    
    return true
}
```
