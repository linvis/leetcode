## 题目

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

### 解法1

买卖股票问题，这里允许多次买卖

自己的解答, 贪心

已知上一次股票买卖是, $valley_i, peak_i$，那么对于新的买卖$valley_j, peak_j$，首先检查能否和上一次买卖操作和在一起，然后检查分开为两次操作后，是否会获取最大利润

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
    if len(prices) <= 0 {
        return 0
    }
    p1, p2, prev, cur := prices[0], prices[0], 0, 0
    
    for i, p := range prices {
        if p < p2 {
            p2 = p
            continue
        }
      	// 判断1
        if p - p1 + prev > p - p2 + cur {
            cur = p - p1 + prev
            p2 = prices[i]
            continue
        }
        // 判断2
        if p - p2 + cur > cur {
            p1 = p2
            cur = p - p2 + cur
            p2 = prices[i]
        }
    }
    
    return cur
}
```

### 解法2

根据解法1，对于能合并两个买卖操作的，其实判断2已经能够合并两个操作了，`p2 = prices[i]`

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
    if len(prices) <= 0 {
        return 0
    }
    p1, cur := prices[0], 0
    
    for i, p := range prices {
        if p < p1 {
            p1 = p
            continue
        }

        if p - p1 + cur > cur {
            cur = p - p1 + cur
            p1 = prices[i]
        }
    }
    
    return cur
}
```

实际上 D = A + B + C

因此，只需要相邻两个比较，得到的分段profit，加起来即为最大

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
    if len(prices) <= 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    profit := 0
    
    for i := 1; i < len(prices); i++ {
        if prices[i] > prices[i - 1] {
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        }    
    }
    
    return profit
}
```
