## 题目

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

## 思路

最简单的就是针对 4，9等case，直接算好罗马文，但是不够通用

这里写了一种通用的解法

```go
type SymbolNum struct {
    bound int
    roman string
}

func intToRoman(num int) string {
    symbol := map[int]SymbolNum{
        1000: SymbolNum{100, "M"},
        500:  SymbolNum{100, "D"},
        100:  SymbolNum{10, "C"},
        50:  SymbolNum{10, "L"},
        10:  SymbolNum{1, "X"},
        5:  SymbolNum{1, "V"},
        1:  SymbolNum{0, "I"},
    }
    
    keys := []int{}
    
    for k := range symbol {
        keys = append(keys, k)
    }
    sort.Ints(keys)
    
    ans := ""
    
    for i := len(keys) - 1; num > 0; {
        if num - keys[i] >= 0 {
            ans += symbol[keys[i]].roman
            num = num - keys[i]
        } else if num >= keys[i] - symbol[keys[i]].bound {
            ans += symbol[symbol[keys[i]].bound].roman + symbol[keys[i]].roman
            num = num - (keys[i] - symbol[keys[i]].bound)
        } else {
            i--
        }
    }
    
    return ans
}
```
