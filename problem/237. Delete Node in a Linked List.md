## 题目

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

 

**Note:**

* The linked list will have at least two elements.
* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
* Do not return anything from your function.

## 思路

这道题目出的有问题，纯粹为了题目而出题(比如规定了不准删除尾结点)

正常情况下，删除一个list的中的node节点，需要给定head和node

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func deleteNode(node *ListNode) {
    node.Val = node.Next.Val
    node.Next = node.Next.Next
}
```
